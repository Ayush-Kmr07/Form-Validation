## Introduction

Form validation is a crucial aspect of web development that ensures the data submitted through forms is accurate, complete, and meets specific requirements. By implementing validation techniques, you can minimize errors, prevent malicious activities, and improve user satisfaction.

This project provides a guide and code examples to perform form validation using client-side approaches. It covers essential validation tasks such as checking for empty fields, validating email addresses, validating phone number, password strength, and more.

## Features

- Client-side form validation using JavaScript and HTML5.
- Common form validation tasks:
  - Empty field detection
  - Email address validation
  - Phone Number validation
  - Password strength checking
  - Password Reconfirmation
- Error message handling for invalid form submissions
- Cross-browser compatibility

## Getting Started

To use the form validation techniques demonstrated in this project, follow these steps:

1. Open the index.html file in any browser.
2. Or click on this link:  https://ayush-kmr07.github.io/Form-Validation/
3. Explore the different validation  available in the web page.
4. If all the user input is validated true, then after clicking on SUBMIT button our page will get refreshed otherwise our page will show Validation error to user.

To view the code of this project, follow these steps:
1. Simply, open the index.html, index.js, styles.css in any IDE such as Visual Studio Code.

## Client-Side Validation

Client-side validation is performed in the user's browser using JavaScript. It provides instant feedback to users before submitting the form, improving the user experience.

To implement client-side validation, you can use JavaScript frameworks like jQuery, or write plain JavaScript code. The `client-side-validation` directory in this repository contains examples of form validation using plain JavaScript.
